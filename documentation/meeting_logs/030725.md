# March 7th, 2025 Meeting Log
## Meeting Information
- Date: March 7th, 2025
- Time: 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM
- Location: Remote (Discord Call)
- Objective: Part 3: 
- Team Members Present: Drew, Dellie, Evan, Manoj, James

## Meeting Summary
- **Project Part 3 Objectives**
    - Use our requirements documents to develop a comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) model that accurately represents the data requirements
    and relationships for our database project.
    - This model will serve as a blueprint for our database design, capturing the essential entities, relationships, and constraints based on the
    requirements we have gathered.
    - No formal template is required, but the following sections should be included in a requirement document:
    - **Introduction**
        - **Project Overview**: Write a brief paragraph summarizing the purpose and primary functions of the database.
        - **Scope**: Provide a concise paragraph defining the boundaries of the project. The last two submissions establish continuity with the rest of the project.
        - **Glossary**: Create a list of key terms and acronyms used in your project. Define each term clearly to ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of the terminology.
    - **Identify ER Modeling Components**
        - **Identify Entities**: List all the major entities that will be part of your database. This includes the initial entities in the project description, the ones you identified during the requirements engineering, and the additional ones during your team brainstorming.
        - **Define Attributes**: For each entity, list its attributes and specify the data types or constraints.
            - Ex: The `Book` entity might have attributes such as `ISBN`, `Title`, etc.
        - **Define Relationships**: Determine how the entities are related to each other. Define the multiplicity (one-to-one, many-to-many, etc.) and any constraints.
            - Ex: A `Book` can be written by one or more `Author`, and a `Purchase` can include multiple `Book`.
    - **Create the ER Model**: Use a diagramming tool to create the ER model. Ensure that the model includes:
        - All identified entities and their attributes.
        - Primary keys for each entity.
        - All relevant relationships between entities with appropriate cardinality in `min..max` format.
        - Any additional constraints or notes that are relevant (but not directly presented in the ER model).

## Task Completion Confirmation
- All tasks in progress as we brainstorm the ER model components.

## Tasks Allocated
- Entire group plans to meet in the late afternoon / evening of March 10th to identify the ER modeling components and to generate the ER model.
