## Meeting Summary
This meeting is the initial "official" meeting for our group. During this meeting, we had our initial introductions and we discussed our goals and visions project. We first focused on getting to know what each group member's previous programming experience is and how we should allocate responsiblites for this project. The Project Roles can be found in the Deliverable for Project 1. Afterwards, we spent time deciding what the scope the of the project should. This includes the features that the project should cover, and features that we should exclude.
