This folder contains all of our meeting logs, chronicled in the
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) format. Each markdown file
can be viewed on GitHub as fully-rendered HTML, or in your favorite
text editor as plaintext. The name of each file is the date the meeting took
place.
