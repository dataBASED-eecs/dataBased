# EECS 447 Final Project Part 1

## Vision Statement
Libraries play an important role in facilitating interactions between members of a community. It is within the walls of library that individuals are able to: 
- Share knowledge through the use of Library Materials
- Provide third spaces to allow members of a community to meet up
- Host community events to better the lives of people in the community

Due to the importance of libraries within a community, it is imperative that the systems that libraries use are elegant, efficient, and scalable. In this project, we are tasked with providing this interface to allow for these interactions.

**Vision Statement**: The library management system will facilitate efficient interactions with library materials for members and staff. Team 19 pledges to ensure the following visions are met:
- The Library System shall provide an efficient interface for members to obtain, utilize, and/or return library inventory.
- The Library System shall provide an elegant interface for library staff to obtain a holistic view of all the resources that the library has to provide.
- The Library System shall provide an scalable interface for library administration to easily add resources that the library can provide.

Libraries are more than just a place to check out books. They are an essential in defining the characteristics of a community. Whether it a meetup with old K-12 friends or voting for the first time, some of the most meaningful interactions individuals people can have are libraries. The members of Team 19 want to create this project because we want to provide that "elegant, efficient, and scalable" interface that libraries can use to improve their productive. Being able to capture the essential characteristics and representing in an intuitive fashion allows libraries to provide for the members of their community without having to concern with inefficient and obsolete inventory-tracking mechanisms. We want libraries to only focus on providing for their community

***Team 19 recognizes that there have been many attacks on the autonomy of libraries as means of connection to the community. Team 19 condemns any actions taken to take advantage of the outreach that libraries have in their community. Team 19 strongly believes that libraries should be a location for discourse, not censorship.***

## Scope Statement
In accordance to the vision statement, the project will provide encompass the following feature:
- Users
  - Searching for available items in inventory
  - Checking out/Returning library materials
  - Donating Library Materials
  - Reserving Library Community Rooms
  - Registering for a membership
  - Registering for community events
  - Placing materials on hold.
  - Viewing all books by a specific author that the library posses.
  - Renewing borrowed items if no holds are placed.
  - Viewing currently borrowed/checked-out books.
  - Viewing fines for books that are returned late
  - Paying late fines

- Staff
  - Handling/Tracking membership status
  - Handling material check out/returns
  - Handling room reservations
  - Tracking of how many books each member has donated.
  - Posting Community Events
  - Ability to add new materials when the Library aquires them.
  - Ability to remove material from public circulation.
  - Tracking and resolving overdue fines/fees.

This project will not encompass the following features
- Users
  - Ability to access materials held by other libraries.
  - Handling of monetary donations.
  - Selling library materials.
  - Accessing external databases outside of the library's collection.
  - Creation and management of personal book collections for users(favorites, TBR, etc.).
  - Sugesting books and other materials based on a user's history
  - Physical location of library materials within a library map
- Staff
  - An inter-library loan system.
  - A system to raise fund for the library.
  - Staff management or payroll features.
  - Data analytics or insights into library data over time.
  - Tracking library expenses
  - Sugesting books that the library should aquire

The reasons for what we chose to/chose not to provide for this interface is simple: we want a solution that can be utilized for any library. The essential features detailed above encompass the most essential features that a library can provide. We want it to be possible for every library to implement this system. Team 19 notes that every library has their own essential features and these features can supported due to our third part of our pledge in the vision statement.
