# EECS 447 Final Project Part 4

## Introduction

### Project Overview

The purpose of our Library Management System is to provide an effective method for knowledge sharing, community meeting, and community events within the library. The system enables members to check out and return materials while tracking overdue fees. Additionally, members can view and register for community events. Library staff can manage inventory, oversee late fees, and organize events.
### Scope

This project consists of the development of a database system to manage library materials, member checkouts, event registrations, and administrative tasks. It allows members to reserve rooms, track fees, and donate materials. Staff can administer fines, process returns, and manage inventory. The system excludes financial features such as payroll, fundraising, or donations. It also does not incorporate analytics or recommendations. The system is designed for single-library use and without inter-library communication.
